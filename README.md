This is a back-end project that is the core server-side component of the What to wear project. The responsibilities are:

- exposing a RESTful API for the front / end clients
- retrieving and persisting data in the MongoDB database
- manages user accounts and authentication
- enforces security measures such as validation and CORS
- running automated tests

project and some challenges I faced while building it.

## Features

- user profiles: get/update profile data
- CRUD (create, read, update, delete)
- error handling & validation: input validation & standard error responses

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
